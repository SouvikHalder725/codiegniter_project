Vidya Balan  at Kolkata, Talking about women’s health, she said, “Women don’t want to acknowledge the body. We don’t want to acknowledge its desire or need, let alone take care of it. It is you (the gynecologists) who teach us to take care of our bodies. Thank you so much for that. Women’s health does not solely lie on the women themselves. Even when we have the best doctors and the best gynecologists in the country, I think there is a need to change in attitude that needs to start at home. I think families need to address the health of women. It is up to everybody in the family to take care of us. Health is wealth. If we want to be a successful and progressive nation, we need to invest in the health of women. We need education and awareness. A small step can go a long way. When a woman visits her gynecologist she should insist that her father, partner, or sons come with them. This shame and guilt over our bodies will have to go. Only then we can head towards a better future.”
